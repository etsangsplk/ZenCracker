ZenCracker
==========

**General informations**

Zen is a powerful hash brute-forcer, written in pure Python, released in late 2013. It is currently in BETA version, meaning it is not 100% completed. Here are some of the currently in-development Zen's features:

MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 algorithms implementation
Two cracking methods, for now only one is available, the other is still under development
A 700MB big dictionary, containing 63941096 human passwords
An advanced hash-computing method, is a bit slow with large files, but works well also on old machines
Can work with basically every wordlist available online. (if set properly)
Fully customizable via a simple .config file
Zen is currently free, when the final version will be released its cost will be $5. However, you may consider that you'll get all of the future updates for free, and Zen is a very powerful hash-cracking tool, so the price is totally worth it.
